        <p class="col-sm-4"> "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
            praising pain
            was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of
            the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
            avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
            pleasure
            rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
            pursues or
            desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur
            in which toil
            and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
            laborious
            physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with
            a man who
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that
            produces no resultant
            pleasure?" </p>
